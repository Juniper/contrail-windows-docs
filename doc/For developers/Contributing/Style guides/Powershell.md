As our team has chosen Visual Studio Code as code editor, we recommend using 'Format On Save' setting. It will reformat some powershell syntax on save.

# General

## Coding style

* Use first uppercase letter in class names. For example [String], not [string]
* Use specific type instead of [PSobject] when possible.
* If abbreviation is in any name, only the first letter should be uppercase. For example: ObjectFqName, not ObjectFQName.
* Use single quote when variable resolving is not needed.
